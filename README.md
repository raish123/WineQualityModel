# Wine Quality Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains several features that describe the chemical properties of different wine samples. The goal is to predict the wine's quality, which is a subjective score given by wine experts. The dataset includes the following features:

- **fixed acidity**: Tartaric acid levels in g/dm³
- **volatile acidity**: Acetic acid levels in g/dm³
- **citric acid**: Citric acid levels in g/dm³
- **residual sugar**: Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation in g/dm³
- **chlorides**: Salt content in g/dm³
- **free sulfur dioxide**: Free SO₂ levels in mg/dm³
- **total sulfur dioxide**: Total SO₂ levels in mg/dm³
- **density**: Density of the wine in g/cm³
- **pH**: Measure of acidity or alkalinity
- **sulphates**: Potassium sulphate levels in g/dm³
- **alcohol**: Alcohol content in % by volume
- **quality**: Quality score (integer value between 0 and 10)
- **Id**: Unique identifier for each sample

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the distribution and relationships between different chemical properties and wine quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Model Development**: Train various machine learning models to predict wine quality.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.
- **Deployment**: Develop a simple web application or API to make predictions on new data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
